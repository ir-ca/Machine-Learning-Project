# Machine Learning project: Fashion MNIST Image Classification

This is an exam project of Machine Learning made by /ir-ca and /Pietrosittoni.
We worked on Image Classification using Machine Learning techniques. Our Image Classification problem is a supervised learning one: given a data set,
we want to learn a function which captures the information
content in the examples and therefore be able to predict the
class of a new example. The goal is to classify new clothing
images into one of 10 possible classes. To do this we implemented 4 different models: a regularized Support Vector
Machine, a Random Forest, a K-Nearest Neighbors and a
Neural Network. We compared them and look for the optimal method. We got the best results with the Support Vector
Machine, but it was the slowest. However, it must be emphasized that, as we will see, there are common mistakes
between SVM, Random Forest and K-NN and we tried to
identify them and formulate a reason why they were made.
We used Python as programming language.
